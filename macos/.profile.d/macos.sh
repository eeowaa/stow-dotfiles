# By default, Homebrew installs GNU utilities by prefixing each of their
# installed files with "g", thus avoiding name conflicts with existing tools.
#
# However, sometimes it is desireable to prefer the GNU version of a utility to
# the standard BSD version that ships with Darwin, without specifying the "g"
# prefix.  There are a few options: override the Homebrew installation process,
# alias commands as needed, or add to PATH and MANPATH as needed.
#
# For now, I prefer the third option, as I see this as being slightly easier
# to document my configuration.
