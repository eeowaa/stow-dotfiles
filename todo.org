* README [1/3]
** TODO Discuss dotfile management systems
*** TODO Discuss pros and cons of each approach
- Portability
  - Dependencies
- Configurability
  - Templates
  - Includes
- Maintainability
  - Simplicity
  - Modularity

I believe that the GNU Stow approach strikes the best balance:
- Very light and portable dependencies
- No templates, but includes work for most dotfiles
- Easily the most maintainable

*** TODO Explain my experience with and rationale for using each approach
** HOLD Describe each Stow package
I would like to reorganize the =GNUmakefile= targets first, so that my
documentation can mirror the =GNUmakefile=.

** DONE Discuss the XDG Base Directory specification
* Makefile [4/5]
** TODO Reorganize =Makefile= targets according to =.stash/.local/etc/modules=
** DONE Define dependencies between each target
I would like to reorganize the =GNUmakefile= targets first, which might help in
discovering dependencies.

** DONE Figure out how to define the default Makefile recipe
I just asked a question on StackOverflow:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65297474/gnu-make-how-to-specify-a-default-recipe-for-all-phony-rules

** DONE Modify the ~stow~ invocation to ignore temporary files
#+begin_src gitignore
# Vim swap files
*.sw[a-p]

# Emacs autosave files
\#*#
.#*

# Various backup files
*.bak
*~
*.~[1-9]~
#+end_src

** DONE Modify the ~stow~ invocation to allow this repo to be cloned anywhere
I would rather clone to =~/src/life/stow-dotfiles= than to =~/stow-dotfiles=

* Dotfiles [9/12]
** STRT Remove XDG Base Directory compliance
Before I get to this, I'd like to finish compliance across all the programs I
/currently/ have dotfiles for (I'm closer to achieving that than backing out).
Any newly-added program dotfiles should just use default paths.

*UPDATE*: I've changed my mind on this. I'd rather just remove XDG conformity
(notice the subtle change in vocabulary) because I don't see a point anymore.
I've already started ripping out useless XDG stuff. The following packages could
/potentially/ still use some work:

- [ ] aws
- [ ] bash
- [ ] linux
- [ ] lynx
- [ ] node
- [ ] perl
- [ ] python
- [ ] X11
- [ ] xterm
- [ ] zsh

** TODO Profile the duration of sourcing =.profile.d/*= and =.environ.d/*= files
There is room for speed improvements. I think that ~npx~ might have something to
do with the slowness.

** TODO Create packages containing config for certain package combinations
For example, macOS-specific Emacs configuration could go in a =macos+emacs=
package, rather than in =macos= or =emacs=.

** KILL Group Vim files
Because Vim doesn't load packages from =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/pack/=, this is one
case where I use the default =$HOME/.vim/= and don't even try to fight it
(although I could symlink that directory to =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/=).

** KILL Move history files from =$XDG_CACHE_HOME= to =$XDG_DATA_HOME=
This is the standard. But first I'd like to finish fumbling through it the
"wrong" way I've been doing, for consistency's sake.
