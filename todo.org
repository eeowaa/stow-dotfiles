* README [1/3]
** TODO Discuss dotfile management systems
*** TODO Discuss pros and cons of each approach
- Portability
  - Dependencies
- Configurability
  - Templates
  - Includes
- Maintainability
  - Simplicity
  - Modularity

I believe that the GNU Stow approach strikes the best balance:
- Very light and portable dependencies
- No templates, but includes work for most dotfiles
- Easily the most maintainable

*** TODO Explain my experience with and rationale for using each approach
** HOLD Describe each Stow package
I would like to reorganize the =Makefile= targets first, so that my
documentation can mirror the =Makefile=.

** DONE Discuss the XDG Base Directory specification
* Makefile [2/5]
** TODO Modify the ~stow~ invocation to allow this repo to be cloned anywhere
I would rather clone to =~/src/life/stow-dotfiles= than to =~/stow-dotfiles=

** TODO Reorganize =Makefile= targets according to =.stash/.local/etc/modules=
** HOLD Define dependencies between each target
I would like to reorganize the =Makefile= targets first, which might help in
discovering dependencies.

** DONE Figure out how to define the default Makefile recipe
I just asked a question on StackOverflow:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65297474/gnu-make-how-to-specify-a-default-recipe-for-all-phony-rules

** DONE Modify the ~stow~ invocation to ignore temporary files

# Vim swap files

# Emacs autosave files

# Various backup files

** STRT Fix XDG Base Directory compliance for ZSH

** STRT Group Vim files
Because Vim doesn't load packages from =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/pack/=, this is one
case where I use the default =$HOME/.vim/= and don't even try to fight it
(although I could symlink that directory to =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/=).

** TODO Profile the duration of sourcing =.profile.d/*= and =.environ.d/*= files
There is room for speed improvements. I think that ~npx~ might have something to
do with the slowness.

** HOLD Move history files from =$XDG_CACHE_HOME= to =$XDG_DATA_HOME=
This is the standard. But first I'd like to finish fumbling through it the
"wrong" way I've been doing, for consistency's sake.

** HOLD Remove XDG Base Directory compliance
Before I get to this, I'd like to finish compliance across all the programs I
/currently/ have dotfiles for (I'm closer to achieving that than backing out).
Any newly-added program dotfiles should just use default paths.
