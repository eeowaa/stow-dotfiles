* DONE Figure out how to define the default Makefile recipe
I just asked a question on StackOverflow:

* DONE Add submodule for Vim packages
* TODO Modify the ~stow~ invocation to allow this repo to be cloned anywhere
I would rather clone to ~/src/life/stow-dotfiles than to ~/stow-dotfiles

* TODO Flesh out =README.org= for each Stow package
* TODO Define dependencies between each target
* TODO Profile the duration of sourcing =.profile.d/*= and =.environ.d/*= files
There is room for speed improvements
