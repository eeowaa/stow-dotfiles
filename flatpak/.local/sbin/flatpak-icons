    This script could use some work.  Open it, read the TODO section, and try
    to fix it.  If you don't feel like fixing it, run this script again with
    the \`-f' or \`--force' flag.

# TODO: Use a better approach
#
# Observations:
# - GNOME is supposed to read .desktop files from every `applications`
#   subdirectory of directories specified in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
# - $XDG_DATA_DIRS contains /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share and
#   ~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share.
# - Flatpak should symlink .desktop files into
#   /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications for system flatpaks and into
#   ~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications for user flatpaks.
# - Beyond /usr/share/applications, there is also /usr/local/share/applications
#   and ~/.local/share/applications.
# - ~/.local/share/applications does not have a corresponding entry in
#   $XDG_DATA_DIRS, but $XDG_DATA_HOME does default to ~/.local/share, and
#   GNOME supposedly looks in ~/.local/share/applications; I need to very this.
# - If you cannot get the Flatpak-specific `applications' directories to work,
#   then at least try to install them into the generic `applications'
#   directories corresponding to the installation prefix.
# - User edits should go into a copy (not a symlink) of a .desktop file so that
#   it won't be overwritten by application updates.
